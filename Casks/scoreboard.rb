# Cask template for acheris-labs/homebrew-tools (Casks/scoreboard.rb).
# Rendered by the release workflow with envsubst: VERSION and SHA_APP come
# from the release's notarized app zip.
#
# One artifact installs the whole product: the app owns the state and listens
# on the unix socket, and ships the CLI inside the bundle as a zipapp - the
# `binary` stanza symlinks it onto PATH. Signed, notarized, stapled.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Scoreboard is opening now - look for the stoplight icon in the menu bar
    (top-right of the screen). The Claude Code hooks have been registered in
    ~/.claude/settings.json for you (a timestamped backup was written first);
    uninstalling removes them again.

    Start a Claude session and it appears on the board. Clicking a session
    jumps to its terminal tab.

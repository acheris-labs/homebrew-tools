# Cask template for acheris-labs/homebrew-tools (Casks/scoreboard.rb).
# Rendered by the release workflow with envsubst: VERSION and SHA_APP come

# One artifact installs the whole product: the app owns the state and listens
# on the unix socket, and ships the CLI inside the bundle as a zipapp - the
# `binary` stanza symlinks it onto PATH. Signed, notarized, stapled.

  # Open on install: Scoreboard is a menu bar app with no Dock icon, so a
  # fresh install is otherwise invisible - nothing launches and the caveats
  # scroll past. Opening it puts the stoplight in the menu bar, where the
  # next step (scoreboard init) can actually be found.

  # `brew uninstall --zap scoreboard` is the full teardown: session state,
  # snapshot, and hook log. The Claude Code hooks live in the user's own
  # settings.json, which scoreboard only edits on request - run
  # `scoreboard init --remove` before zapping to unwind those.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Scoreboard is opening now - look for the stoplight icon in the menu bar
    (top-right of the screen). Next:

      scoreboard init     # register the Claude Code hooks

    Clicking a session in the menu jumps to its terminal tab.
